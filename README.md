Copyright notice: Facebook is a trademark of Facebook Inc. This app is NOT connected to Facebook Inc. whatsoever. This app only helps using the official Facebook Mobile website. 

Important: It does NOT display notifications (I recommend Notiface) and has some limitations (eg. no access to your location so you cannot check-in automatically, no access to your files so you cannot send pictures for now) 

App suspended by Google Play.
Now open source and avaliable to everyone.

Have fun! ;)

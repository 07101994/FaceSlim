With Fb Lite you can keep in touch with your friends even if you are not using the official Facebook app! 

Download link: https://github.com/indywidualny/FacebookLite/releases

What makes the application awesome:

* modern design (material) 
* chat support 
* pull to refresh
* NO ADS
* always in your language 
* no extra permissions (INTERNET only) 

Refresh the page by pulling down with your finger. External links will open in your system browser as well as the full size images so you can zoom in, save, etc. The latest devices (KitKat and Lollipop) - blue status bar background. This application only requires access to the Internet - any additional permissions are not needed. The application will always be free and without ads! 

Copyright notice: Facebook is a trademark of Facebook Inc. This app is NOT connected to Facebook Inc. whatsoever. This app only helps using the official Facebook Mobile website. 

Important: It does NOT display notifications (I recommend Notiface) and has some limitations (eg. no access to your location so you cannot check-in automatically, no access to your files so you cannot send pictures for now) 

App suspended by Google Play.
Now open source and avaliable to everyone.

Have fun! ;)
